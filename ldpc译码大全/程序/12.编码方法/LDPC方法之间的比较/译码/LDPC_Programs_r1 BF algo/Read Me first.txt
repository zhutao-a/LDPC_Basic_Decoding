ldpc_dB_test.m -  to generate a text file for BER/SNR values.  Uses BPSK. Change max values to shorten simulation time
ldpc_bf.m - BF algorithm
ldpc_wbf.m - WBF algorithm
ldpc_iwbf.m - IWBF algorithm
ldpc_irrwbf.m - IRRWBF algorithm
ga.mat - 200,52 Generator matrix, taken from http://www.kozintsev.net/soft/ldpc_distr.zip
ha.mat - 200,150 LDPC Matrix, sparse format, taken from http://www.kozintsev.net/soft/ldpc_distr.zip

NOTE:  
Codes were created using Matlab R2006a
Some files needs the Communication Toolbox to run.
Before running the code you may want to change the following in ldpc_dB_test.m.
	max_block - number of message blocks to transmit.  Affects simulation length/time.
	alp - optimum value for IWBF, varies on SNR and (N,K).
	
1. Load ga, ha. eg load ga
2. Convert ha to full matrix.  eg. Hs=full(ha)
3. Run ldpc_dB_test file eg. ldpc_dB_test(Ga,Hs,100,7,0.5);
	Generates a text file for SNR performance from 0-7dB at 0.5 intervals.
4. Wait for the simulation to complete.
5. Open file ...*results.txt.  Use Matlab/Wordpad to open as text.
	File name format is mm-dd_hr-min_NxK_results.txt
	I changed it so that I will know when the simulation started and what the matrix size is.
